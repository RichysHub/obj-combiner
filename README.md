Flask project to dynamically combine object meshes

From a request, composite a single .obj, and pack textures to a single image

Current state is quite the mess, this project was relatively early in my Python learning
Large amount of code copied from theFroh's imagepacker, in an attempt to get a working product.
Have submitted Pull request for bug found in such code.
Really a proof of concept, further work is planned, including refined OO style, and large custom library of models

Files in the database refer to dropbox files, currently using placeholder files, of unknown origin.
Constructed using flask, for hosting upon pythonanywhere

Repository dormant, project on hold.

Single character model created for new system. 
Many more character models and equipment models planned.
Code here would combine models into single wavefron .obj, and single image texture

Created and posed in Blender
