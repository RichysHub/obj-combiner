Flask project to dynamically combine object meshes

From a request, composite a single .obj, and pack textures to a single image

Current state is quite the mess.
Large amount of code copied from theFroh's imagepacker
Really a proof of concept, further work is planned, including refined OO style, and large custom library of models
