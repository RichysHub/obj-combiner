Flask project to dynamically combine object meshes

From a request, composite a single .obj, and pack textures to a single image

Current state is quite the mess.
Large amount of code copied from theFroh's imagepacker, in an attempt to get a working product.
Really a proof of concept, further work is planned, including refined OO style, and large custom library of models

Files in the database refer to dropbox files, currently using placeholder files, of unknown origin.
Constructed using flask, for hosting upon pythonanywhere
